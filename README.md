# PyBer_Analysis

##Analysis Overview 

Data was collected showing ride information in various environments (suburban, urban and rural). We wanted to look at total fare amounts, their averages and compare the city types over the course of several months. 

##Results 

Due to the higher number of rides and drivers occurring in the urban environment, this causes the average fare per ride and fare per driver to be lower. 

##Summary

Overall, the urban environment is where PyBer stands to earn more money and expand. One recommendation would be to hire more or less drivers within the urban environment dependent on the month of the year - which would require some analysis as to when people are more likely to request a ride. A recommendation for expanding into the urban and suburban market would be to look at how much hours a typical driver is spending covering down on the requested rides. The number of total rides versus available drivers is higher. Hiring more drivers may cause prices to go down but how would this impact the workday of the drivers?
